Subject: [announce] Vicare/Expat revision 0.1d0

			      Vicare/Expat
			      ============


This  package is a  distribution of  C and  Scheme libraries  for Vicare
Scheme, an  R6RS compliant  Scheme implementation; it  provides bindings
for the  Expat C  language library, an  XML parser library.   While this
package can  be used alone,  its purpose is  to provide a  backend Expat
interface for Nausicaa/Expat: a higher level interface.

  The last  time the  author bothered to  update this paragraph,  he had
tested Expat version 2.0.1.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.
