1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a distribution of C and Scheme libraries for
Vicare Scheme,  an R6RS compliant  Scheme implementation; it
provides bindings  for the Expat C language  library, an XML
parser  library.  Expat  must  be compiled  to handle  UTF-8
strings.

  If  the package Nausicaa/Scheme  is installed:  a Nausicaa
front end  library for Vicare/Expat  is installed, providing
higher level constructs.

  The  last   time  the  author  bothered   to  update  this
paragraph, he had tested Expat version 2.0.1.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

Vicare Scheme needs to be compiled with FFI support enabled,
because Expat heavily relies on C callbacks.

  Before  installing  Vicare/Expat   make  sure  to  have  a
correctly installed Expat  library.  To install Vicare/Expat
do this:

   $ cd vicare-expat-0.1.0
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure --enable-shared --disable-static
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/vicare-expat

  After  installation, the  makefile  rule "vfasl-installed"
will  precompile the  libraries installed  in  the hierarchy
(vicare expat ---).

A. Credits
----------

Vicare/Expat was  written by Marco Maggi.   Vicare Scheme is
an R6RS compliant fork  of Ikarus Scheme; originally created
by Abdulaziz Ghuloum, it is now maintained by Marco Maggi.

  Expat is the creation of  James Clark, who's also given us
groff (an nroff look-alike),  Jade (an implemention of ISO's
DSSSL stylesheet  language for SGML), XP (a  Java XML parser
package),  XT  (a Java  XSL  engine).   James  was also  the
technical lead on the XML Working Group at W3C that produced
the XML specification.
