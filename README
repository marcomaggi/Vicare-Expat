1. Introduction
---------------

This package  is a  distribution of  C and  Scheme libraries  for Vicare
Scheme, an  R6RS compliant  Scheme implementation; it  provides bindings
for the Expat C language library,  an XML parser library.  Expat must be
compiled to handle UTF-8 strings.

  If  the package  Nausicaa/Scheme is  installed: a  Nausicaa front  end
library   for  Vicare/Expat   is  installed,   providing  higher   level
constructs.

  The last time the maintainer bothered to update this paragraph, he had
tested  Expat version  2.0.1.   This package  requires  at least  Vicare
Scheme revision 0.3d1.

  This package  makes use  of the GNU  Autotools.  The  maintainer tests
only on GNU+Linux systems.

3. Install
----------

Vicare Scheme  needs to  be compiled with  FFI support  enabled, because
Expat  heavily relies  on C  callbacks.  Before  installing Vicare/Expat
make sure to have a correctly installed Expat library.

  To install Vicare/Expat from a  proper release tarball, we must unpack
the archive then do:

   $ cd vicare-expat-0.1.0
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

notice  that  the  "configure"  script  is  prepared  to  enable  shared
libraries  and  disable static  libraries:  this  must not  be  changed,
because  the package  is  meant to  install  a C  shared  library to  be
dynamically loaded.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/vicare-expat

  If, instead,  we have checked out  a revision from the  repository, we
will have  to first build the  infrastructure running a script  from the
top source directory:

   $ cd vicare-expat
   $ sh autogen.sh

after this  the procedure  is the same  as the one  for building  from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  Libraries are installed under the directory:

		  $(libdir)/vicare-scheme

  After   installation,  the   makefile   rule  "vfasl-installed"   will
precompile the libraries installed in the hierarchies (vicare expat ---)
and (nausicaa xml expat ---); the make file rule "installcheck" will run
the test suite against the installed libraries.

A. Credits
----------

Vicare/Expat  was written  by Marco  Maggi.   Vicare Scheme  is an  R6RS
compliant  fork  of  Ikarus  Scheme;  originally  created  by  Abdulaziz
Ghuloum, it is now maintained by Marco Maggi.

  Expat is  the creation of James  Clark, who's also given  us groff (an
nroff  look-alike),  Jade (an  implemention  of  ISO's DSSSL  stylesheet
language  for SGML),  XP (a  Java XML  parser package),  XT (a  Java XSL
engine).  James was also the technical  lead on the XML Working Group at
W3C that produced the XML specification.
